## Description

Objectives:  

-  Use development tools: Haskell, IDE/source code editor, git
, Github Actions, and laboratory work process

-  Design algorithms and data structures in mutable styles

-  Develop unit and property-based tests Students should meet with tools and
typical development workflow on the classical development task in the first
laboratory work: developing a library for a specific data structure.

Students should implement the selected by the variants data structure as a
mutable object (interaction with an object should modify it if applicable). All
 changes should be performed in place, by changing the initial structure.

## Struct of project

-  The main.hs in app/ is just a file init by cabal. It doesn't matter.

-  The implementation of Binary Search Tree is in src/BST.hs.
And it exports some functions.

-  The test runs by the cabal, and the test cases are written in test/Tests.hs.

## Contribution

Zhao, Tianhao is responsible for the implementation of the 
data structure and some test cases.  

Ge, Binghang edit the Readme and contribute some test cases, also the action.  

## Key features

The use of Haskell.
