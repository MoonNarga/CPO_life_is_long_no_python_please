## Description

Objectives:

1. Use development tools: Haskell, IDE/source code editor, git
, Github Actions, and laboratory work process

2. Design algorithms and data structures in mutable styles

3. Develop unit and property-based tests Students should meet with tools and 
typical development workflow on the classical development task in the first 
laboratory work: developing a library for a specific data structure.

Students should implement the selected by the variants data structure as a 
mutable object (interaction with an object should modify it if applicable). All
 changes should be performed in place, by changing the initial structure.

## Struct of project

1. The main.hs in app/ is just a file init by cabal. It doesn't matter.

2. The implementation of Binary Search Tree is in src/BST.hs. 
And it exports some functions.

3. The test runs by the cabal, and the test cases are written in test/Tests.hs.
